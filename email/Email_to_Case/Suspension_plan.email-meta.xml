    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName}  {!Contact.LastName},

We’ve placed this number on temporary suspension for a maximum of 6 months until __ 2019.

During this time, the monthly fee will be $15 a month plus applicable taxes and all usage in Canada will be blocked. Please note you are eligible for the temporary suspension plan once in a 12 month period.

If you require any changes to the plan or have a new employee taking over the line prior to 6 months, please contact us to make the necessary updates and remove the hold. After 6 months, if no updates to the line are made, service and monthly fees will automatically be restored.

Thank you, and should you have any additional inquiries please feel free to contact us.
