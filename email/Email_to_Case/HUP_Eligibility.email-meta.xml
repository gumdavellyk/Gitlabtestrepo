Should you wish to proceed with a pre-HUP fee, please note the following:

Early upgrade fee: $XX

Cost of device: $XX

TOTAL COST: $XX

The last upgrade was completed on &lt;&lt;DD MM YYYY&gt;&gt;.

This line will no longer have an early upgrade fee on &lt;&lt;DD MM YYYY&gt;&gt;.

OR

The last upgrade was completed on &lt;&lt;DD MM YYYY&gt;&gt;, therefore the applicable charge will be the cost of the device chosen. If you wish to proceed with the order kindly let us know: Device model &amp; color preference (example: iPhone 8 64gb in space grey) as well as the shipping address. Kindly note that prices are subject to change.
