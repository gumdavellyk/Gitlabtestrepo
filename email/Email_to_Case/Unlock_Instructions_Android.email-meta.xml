    <textOnly>Please see below instructions on how to unlock your Android phone, either for your records, or should you need to distribute to your end users

Note: Unlocking your smartphone will NOT void your manufacturer warranty if done through Rogers. This unlock process requires a non-Rogers SIM card.

1.Turn off your smartphone.

2.Remove your Rogers SIM card from the smartphone.

3.Insert the non-Rogers SIM card back into the smartphone.

4.Turn on the device, and enter when prompted.

5.The device will be unlocked.

Note: Some devices may require a device reboot to complete the process.
